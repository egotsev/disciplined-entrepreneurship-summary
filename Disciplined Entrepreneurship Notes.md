# 1. Market segmentation

## Market basics

Single necessary condition for a business: a paying customer.

It's essential to create a new market instead of being a "me-too company".

## Customers
Primary (end user) and secondary (economic buyer).
Sometimes they overlap. Sometimes business model calls for both.

Multi-sided market case - when the business model needs target customers to be viable (e.g. in airbnb hosts and travellers).

## Segmentation

### Brainstorm

Wide array of market opportunities even such that sound crazy. Talking to potential customers is good even at this early stage.

Do a tree to segment the market opportunities. Even seemingly narrow markets can be segmented to narrower ones.
Potential industries -> Who will benefit from the idea/technology in this industry (focus on end users)? -> Make a narrow segmentation of the users

### Narrow

1. Is the target customer well funded?
2. Is the target customer readily accessible to your sales force?
3. Does the target customer have a compelling reason to buy?
4. Can you today, with the help of partners, deliver a whole product?
5. Is there entrenched competition that could block you?
6. If you win this segment, can you leverage it to enter additional segments?
7. Is the market consistent with the values, passions, and goals of the founding team?

Choose 6-12 markets based on the questions above.

### Primary market research

Talk to potential customers in the markets that have been chosen in the previous step. If there is already a research on the market out in the internet, probably you are late.

1. You do not have “the answer” for your potential customers and their needs.
2. Your potential customers do not have “the answer” for you.
3. Talk with potential customers in “inquiry” mode, not “advocacy/sales” mode. Listen to what they have to say, and don’t try to get them to buy anything.

Organize research:

1. End User: Who specifically would be using your product?
2. Application: What would the end user be using your product for? What is the task that would dramatically improved?
3. Benefits: What is the actual value that the end user would gain?
4. Lead Customers: Who are the most influential customers that others look to for thought and adoption of new technology?
5. Market Characteristics: What about this market would help or hinder the adoption of new technology?
6. Partners/Players: Which companies will you need to work with to provide a solution that integrates into the customer’s workflow?
7. Size of the Market: Roughly, how many potential customers exist if you achieve 100 percent market penetration?
8. Competition: Who is making similar products — real or perceived? (from the customer’s perspective)
9. Complementary Assets Required: What else does your customer need in order to get the “full solution,” that is, to get full functionality from your product? You will likely need to bundle your product with products from other manufacturers so that customers can easily buy your
product and have full functionality.

# 2. Selecting beachhead market

Based on the 7 questions from step 1, choose just one market. This market might still need further segmentation.

Being focused is extremely important. You should continue segmenting until your market matches the:

## Three Conditions That Define a Market
1. The customers within the market all buy similar products.
2. The customers within the market have a similar sales cycle and expect products to provide value in similar ways. Your salespeople can shift from selling to one customer to selling to a different customer and still be very effective with little or no loss of productivity.
3. There is “word of mouth” between customers in the market, meaning they can serve as compelling and high-value references for each other in making purchases. For example, they may belong to the same professional organizations or operate in the same region. If you find a
potential market opportunity where the customers do not talk to each other, you will find it difficult for your startup to gain traction.

# 3. Build end user profile

You must build your business based on the customer you are serving, rather than pushing onto the market the product or service you want to sell.

## CUSTOMER = END USER + DECISION MAKING UNIT

1. **End User:** The individual who will use your product. The end user is usually a member of the household or organization that purchases your product
2. **Decision-Making Unit:** The individual(s) who decide whether the customer will buy your product, consisting of:
 * *Champion*: The person who wants the customer to purchase the product; often the end user.
 * *Primary Economic Buyer*: The person with the authority to spend money to purchase the product. Sometimes this is the end user.
 * *Influencers, Veto Power, Purchasing Department, and so on*: People who have sway or direct control over the decisions of the Primary Economic Buyer.
 
In this step it's important to build a profile of the end user that is specific enough for calculating the **Total Addressable Market** size of the beachhead market.

## Target a specific demographic

Even in the narrowest beachhead market there will be much variety among the end users. Market strategies won't work well for different groups of people.

### POTENTIAL CHARACTERISTICS TO INCLUDE IN YOUR END USER PROFILE
 * What is their gender?
 * What is their age range?
 * What is their income range?
 * What is their geographic location?
 * What motivates them?
 * What do they fear most?
 * Who is their hero?
 * Where do they go for vacation? For dinner? Before work?
 * What newspapers do they read? Websites? What TV shows do they watch?
 * What is the general reason they are buying this product? Savings? Image? Peer pressure?
 * What makes them special and identifiable?
 * What is their story?

Some of these may not be applicable, others may be added.

# 4. Total addressable market

TAM = the amount of annual revenue your business would earn if you achieved 100 percent market share in that market.

## Bottom-up analysis

Counting noses: how many customers (trade associations, customer lists, etc.) and how many end users each customer has.

Very useful here is to have exact amount of end users at some companies and latter estimate number of end users per 1000 people or per million dollars revenue.

## Top-down analysis

This analysis is complementary to the bottom-up analysis.

Using secondary market research estimate how many end users meet different characteristics. Expressed by a inverted pyramid, the bottom-most level are those that match the End User Profile.

## Users -> Revenue

This will need some assumptions. Try to calculate how much the user is spending to do the task that your product will do instead of him. As much as possible, base the number on the budgets of the potential customers you have identified. How much have they paid in the past for other new products? How much value does your product create for them?

## What should your TAM be?
Generally a TAM between $20 and $100 million per year is a good target. It is possible though that an initial TAM of $5 million per year could be a successful business, if you can capture the market quickly and convincingly, especially if the gross margins on your product would be very high (e.g., 90 percent as it would be for software, mobile apps, information-based business models) and you do not need a lot of employees to do it.

As these steps are meant to be part of iterative approach, latter revisit of the TAM will lead to a more credible estimation.
